###### my favorite vacation spot is Araku.

Araku Valley is a hill station and valley region in the southeastern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It's surrounded by the **thick forests** of the Eastern Ghats mountain range. The Tribal Museum is dedicated to the area's numerous **indigenous tribes**, known for their traditional Dhimsa dance, and showcases traditional handicrafts. A miniature train runs through Padmapuram Gardens, with its sculptures and tree-top huts.
